# IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AND_PROGRESS_gpgpu_coverage40

## Goal
Broaden depiction coverage without deleting any existing family, operator recipe, preset, or renderer route.
This phase treats **execution method coverage** and **motion coverage** as first-class planning objects so GPGPU / WebGPU / procedural geometry / particle fields can be expanded systematically instead of ad hoc.

## What this phase adds
- Added a new runtime coverage analyzer in `lib/depictionCoverage.ts`.
- Coverage is now tracked across four additive dimensions:
  - depiction methods
  - motion families
  - compute backends
  - active GPGPU feature bands
- Project manifest stats now expose those counts so exported projects show how broad a scene already is.
- Project I/O UI now displays the new coverage chips.
- Added six GPGPU starter presets so existing GPU motion bands are reachable immediately from the starter library.

## Why this phase matters
The project already had many GPGPU controls and several procedural systems, but they were not organized as a deliberate coverage layer.
That made it harder to answer:
- which depiction methods are already active
- which motion families are already represented
- whether a scene is CPU-only / procedural / WebGL GPGPU / WebGPU compute
- whether GPGPU capability exists but is underexposed in presets

This phase fixes the planning surface first, then exposes more of the existing GPU bandwidth through presets.

## Implemented files
- `lib/depictionCoverage.ts`
  - additive coverage analysis
  - active GPGPU feature extraction
  - motion family / depiction method / backend classification
- `lib/projectState.ts`
  - manifest stats extended with coverage counts
  - GPGPU snapshot features widened beyond ribbon/tube/metaball only
- `types/project.ts`
  - new manifest stat fields
- `components/controlPanelProjectIO.tsx`
  - schema-aware snapshot now shows Methods / Motions / Backends / GPGPU counts
- `lib/starterLibrary.ts`
  - added six GPGPU-focused starter presets and sequence items

## Added starter presets
- `starter-gpgpu-boids-flock-array`
- `starter-gpgpu-curl-vortex-ribbon`
- `starter-gpgpu-attractor-smooth-tube`
- `starter-gpgpu-fluid-metaball`
- `starter-gpgpu-volumetric-ion-cloud`
- `starter-gpgpu-webgpu-curl-field`

## Coverage plan after this phase
### Phase 40A completed
- coverage analyzer layer
- manifest visibility layer
- starter access layer for existing GPGPU bands

### Next careful phases
#### Phase 40B
Add explicit **motion-band scorecards** for:
- flock / swarm
- fluid / SPH
- vortex / curl
- attractor / chaos
- elastic / spring / verlet
- field / wind / gravity well / vector field
- collision / SDF / mouse interaction
- volumetric / metaball / tube / ribbon

#### Phase 40C
Add **coverage browser filters** in UI:
- filter starter presets by backend
- filter starter presets by motion family
- filter starter presets by depiction method

#### Phase 40D
Add **dedicated handcrafted axes** only where generic GPGPU coverage is still weak:
- dense flock structure
- granular GPU packing
- GPU sheet / ribbon advection
- GPU erosion / dissolution style transport

## Non-destructive rule check
- Existing families kept intact
- Existing operator presets kept intact
- Existing renderer routing kept intact
- Existing procedural systems kept intact
- New coverage logic is additive only

## Verification target
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
