# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND PROGRESS — operator36

## Goal
Add source-aware auto weighting and batch-grown operator recipes without deleting any existing family, mode, preset, or renderer.

## Done
- Added source-aware operator weighting to `buildOperatorLayerPatch()`.
- Added source-specific weighting for `text / grid / ring / plane / image / video / sphere / cylinder / cube`.
- Added automatic batch growth: each base operator recipe now expands into two additional source anchors.
- Added auto-generated source review hybrids and temporal review variants.
- Kept all existing manual operator recipes and handcrafted presets intact.

## Coverage
- Base operator recipes: 32
- Auto-expanded operator recipes: 64
- Total operator recipes: 96

## Verification
- `npm ci` passed
- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm run build` passed
