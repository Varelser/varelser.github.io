# Phase 45 — operator / atlas bundle post-stack references

## Goal
Allow operator recipes and expression atlas bundles to reference independent post stacks so depiction + post can be combined as reusable bundles and starter presets.

## Implemented
- Added `postStackId` metadata to `ExpressionAtlasBundle`.
- Added `buildExpressionAtlasPatch()` to merge depiction patch + referenced post stack patch.
- Added operator-side post-stack heuristics in `lib/operatorGeneratedBundles.ts`.
- Atlas buttons now apply depiction patch and paired post stack together.
- Added `OPERATOR_ATLAS_STACK_PRESETS` / sequences so atlas bundles can be saved and replayed as starter presets.

## Result
- Operator bundles are no longer depiction-only.
- Atlas bundles can carry a recommended post identity.
- Starter library now contains bundle-driven depiction + post combinations, closer to TouchDesigner / Red Giant style preset families.

## Next
Phase 46 should move from single bundle pairings to multi-stage product packs:
- TouchDesigner-like feedback chains
- Trapcode-like emitter/render/post packs
- Form-like structured grid packs
- Universe-like retro/post packs
