# Phase 87 — Phase 0 completion

## Goal
Mark Phase 0 complete by making the foundation layer visible and reusable from runtime, diagnostics, UI, and documentation.

## Added
- `lib/motionGrouping.ts`
- `lib/sourceFieldFoundation.ts`
- `lib/simulationAdapter.ts`
- `lib/simulationAdapterBridge.ts`
- `lib/executionManifest.ts`

## Integrated
- `components/motionCatalog.ts` now re-exports shared motion grouping from library
- `components/controlPanelPartsMotion.tsx` now shows engine/path/adapter/source-field metadata
- `lib/executionDiagnostics.ts` now includes adapter/source-field metadata per layer

## Phase 0 completion criteria
- Motion grouping shared outside component layer
- Source field foundation exists
- Simulation adapter foundation exists
- Runtime bridge exists
- Manifest exists for mode-level inspection
- Diagnostics and UI read the same foundation metadata

## Status
Phase 0 can now be treated as complete. Next work should start from true execution foundations rather than more metadata-only shaping.
