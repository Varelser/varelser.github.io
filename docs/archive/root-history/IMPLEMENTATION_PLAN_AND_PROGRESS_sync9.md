# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND PROGRESS sync9

## Goal
Eliminate the highest-priority synchronization drift across:
- layer motion type definitions
- motion catalog grouping
- motion selector exposure
- procedural renderer routing
- project manifest / stats reporting
- render mode registry activation

## What was fixed

### 1. Added a shared procedural mode registry
Created `lib/proceduralModeRegistry.ts` as a common source for:
- procedural system IDs
- mode-to-system mapping
- mode-to-feature-tag mapping

This removes repeated hand-maintained arrays from multiple files.

### 2. Synchronized motion coverage to full mode count
Updated `components/motionCatalog.ts` so all `Layer2Type` motion modes are represented in group catalogs.
Added the missing modes:
- `field`
- `pendulum`
- `braid`

### 3. Synchronized motion selector coverage
Updated `components/controlPanelPartsMotion.tsx` so selector options are generated from `MOTION_GROUPS` with fallback metadata.
Result:
- selector coverage now matches catalog coverage
- selector coverage now matches `Layer2Type` coverage
- newly added modes are reachable from UI without manual duplicate maintenance

### 4. Unified procedural renderer routing in AppScene
Updated `components/AppScene.tsx` to route procedural systems from shared registry helpers instead of repeated ad-hoc arrays.
This closes routing gaps for late-added families such as:
- `shell_script`
- `eclipse_halo`
- `resin_shell`
- `glyph_weave`
- `lattice_surge`
- `fracture_bloom`
- `ember_drift`

### 5. Unified project manifest feature tagging and stats
Updated `lib/projectState.ts` to derive procedural feature tags and procedural mode counts from the shared registry.
This reduces stat drift and ensures manifest reporting reflects current procedural mode coverage.

### 6. Unified render mode registry activation
Updated `lib/renderModeRegistry.ts` so procedural renderer activation conditions also resolve through the shared procedural registry.
This keeps the render registry aligned with AppScene routing.

## Verification
- `scene type / motionCatalog / selector` coverage synchronized to **172 / 172 / 172**.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.

## Highest-priority work completed
Yes.
The top priority was not “add more modes first,” but “make existing modes consistently reachable and correctly routed.”
That synchronization pass is now implemented.

## Recommended next priority
1. Expand `depictionArchitecture.ts` so newer late-added modes are semantically classified there as well.
2. Move selector labels/icons into a dedicated metadata registry to reduce component size.
3. Continue with renderer-specific shaping so families differ more strongly in visible output, not only in routing.
