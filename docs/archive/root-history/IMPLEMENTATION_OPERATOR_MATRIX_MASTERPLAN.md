# Operator Matrix Masterplan

## Goal
Keep every existing family, mode, preset, and renderer intact while adding a non-destructive operator layer that can scale coverage much faster than one-mode-at-a-time work.

## Rule
- Existing files and existing modes are not deleted.
- Existing renderer routing remains the source of truth.
- Operator recipes sit on top of existing modes and generate bundles / starter presets / hybrids.
- Manual crafted presets remain available alongside generated operator presets.
- Source-aware weighting is additive only and must not rewrite existing handcrafted presets.

## Coverage Strategy
The operator layer uses these axes:
- material: ink / ash / resin / glass / crystal / bio / metal / dust / vapor
- geometry: sheet / shell / fog / aggregate / lattice / mesh / front / plate
- dynamics: capillary / advection / vortex / pressure / avalanche / jam / viscoelastic / freeze / melt / sublimate / corrode / creep / grammar / growth / static / erode / dissolve / abrade / pit
- inscription: plain / glyph / ledger / rune / contour / palimpsest
- source: text / grid / plane / ring / image / video / sphere / cylinder / cube
- temporal: existing temporal profile library remains in use

## Why source-aware auto weighting is the next multiplier
The fastest way to increase coverage without deleting anything is:
1. keep the handcrafted family layer intact
2. let operator recipes inherit source-specific weighting automatically
3. batch-expand recipes into multiple source anchors
4. auto-generate comparison hybrids from the grown recipe library

This gives broader coverage while preserving the stronger handcrafted axes for later refinement.

## Implementation Layers
1. `lib/operatorMatrix.ts`
   - operator axis definitions
   - recipe specs
   - source-aware weighting
   - batch-grown recipe variants
2. `lib/operatorGeneratedBundles.ts`
   - convert recipes into atlas bundles
3. `lib/operatorGeneratedStarters.ts`
   - convert recipes into starter presets and starter sequences
4. `lib/operatorGeneratedHybrids.ts`
   - convert matrix logic into hybrid review recipes and temporal review variants
5. existing files receive additive imports only
   - `expressionAtlasBundles.ts`
   - `starterLibrary.ts`
   - `hybridExpressions.ts`
   - `hybridTemporalVariants.ts`

## Current Phase
Phase O1: non-destructive operator layer bootstrap
- add operator matrix and recipe library
- expose generated atlas bundles
- expose generated starter presets
- expose generated hybrid review recipes
- keep existing content untouched

Phase O1.5: erosion / dissolution / wear operator expansion
- add `erode / dissolve / abrade / pit` operator dynamics
- add recipe bundles for `erosion_trail / seep_fracture / residue_skin / calcified_skin`
- add review hybrid for erosion / dissolution / wear comparison
- keep all existing hand-crafted review bundles intact

Phase O2: source-aware operator weighting
- add automatic weighting for `text / grid / ring / plane / image / video / sphere / cylinder / cube`
- automatically rebalance count / size / radius / temporal strength by source
- keep the original recipe definitions unchanged

Phase O3: recipe batch growth
- expand every base operator recipe into two additional source anchors
- grow atlas bundles / starter presets / hybrid review coverage automatically
- keep manual recipes available in parallel

## Current Operator Scale
- base operator recipes: 32
- auto-expanded operator recipes: 64
- total operator recipes: 96
- source-review hybrid recipes: 6 auto-generated + manual reviews

## Next Phases
Phase O4
- duplicate suppression and coverage scoring
- source collision scoring for recipe growth

Phase O5
- UI filter for operator recipes by axis
- matrix browser for material / geometry / dynamics / inscription / source

Phase O6
- promote weak high-value bands into dedicated handcrafted axes
- use collision metrics to decide which bands deserve bespoke renderer parameters
