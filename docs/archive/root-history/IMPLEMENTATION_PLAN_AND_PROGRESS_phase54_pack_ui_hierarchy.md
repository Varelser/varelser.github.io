# Phase 54 — Pack UI Hierarchy / Delta / Reset

## What changed
- Reorganized active pack fine controls into four scopes:
  - Common
  - Pack Specific
  - Family
  - Solver
- Added collapsible hierarchy for scope sections and per-group sections.
- Added base-vs-current delta view for each active control.
- Added per-control reset and per-group reset.
- Added changed-count summaries for:
  - total modified controls
  - scope-level modified counts
  - group-level modified counts

## Why
The previous phase had pack-specific controls, but the control surface was still flat and noisy.
This phase keeps all existing functionality and adds a second layer for:
- better scanning
- easier return to pack defaults
- clearer distinction between base pack state and user-tuned state

## Validation
- TypeScript typecheck: passed
- Vite build: passed

## Coverage status
- Generation-family coverage remains unchanged from Phase 53/51 line:
  - target coverage: 100%
- This phase improves UI reachability and editing granularity, not generation-family breadth.

## UI structure now
- Product Packs
  - scorecards
  - augmentation suggestions
  - active pack fine controls
    - Common
    - Pack Specific
    - Family
    - Solver
- each scope can collapse
- each group can collapse
- each control can show whether it differs from the active pack base patch

## Next logical step
- add delta-only filter
- add per-pack save/duplicate snapshot
- split very large packs into 2nd-page or drawer editing
