# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND PROGRESS shaping17

## Scope
- Compress the visual difference for shell / halo / membrane families.
- Focus on `halo_bloom`, `membrane_pollen`, and `spore_halo`.
- Keep renderer / depictionArchitecture / atlas / hybrid / starter in sync.

## Implemented
1. `components/sceneSurfaceShellSystem.tsx`
   - Added shell profile axes for `haloSharpness`, `equatorBias`, `poreAmount`, `sporeAmount`, `bloomAmount`, `centerDarkness`, and `blendMode`.
   - Extended hull deformation so halo modes compress toward the equator and membrane modes develop porous cut-ins.
   - Added shader uniforms for pore breakup, spore grain, bloom rings, halo sharpness, and center dimming.
   - Switched some shell modes from additive to normal blending for better membrane/script readability.

2. `lib/depictionArchitecture.ts`
   - Refined the architecture descriptions for `halo_bloom`, `membrane_pollen`, and `spore_halo` to match the new shaping logic.

3. `lib/expressionAtlasBundles.ts`
   - Added `halo-bloom-equinox`.
   - Added `membrane-pollen-herbarium`.
   - Added `spore-halo-reliquary`.

4. `lib/hybridExpressions.ts`
   - Added `halo-membrane`.
   - Added `spore-reliquary`.

5. `lib/hybridTemporalVariants.ts`
   - Added `halo-membrane-breath`.
   - Added `spore-reliquary-shed`.

6. `lib/starterLibrary.ts`
   - Added `starter-halo-bloom-equinox`.
   - Added `starter-membrane-pollen-herbarium`.
   - Added `starter-spore-halo-reliquary`.
   - Added matching preset-sequence entries.

## Validation
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`

## Coverage snapshot
- `halo_bloom`: 1 -> 2 starter presets
- `membrane_pollen`: 4 -> 6 starter presets
- `spore_halo`: 4 -> 5 starter presets

## Next recommended target
- Re-compress the difference for `aura_shell`, `eclipse_halo`, and `resin_shell` as a final shell-family polish pass.
- After that, move to export-facing sample curation rather than more renderer expansion.
