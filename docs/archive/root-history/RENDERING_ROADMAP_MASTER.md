# MonoSphere Particle Generator — Rendering Roadmap Master

## Current status
- Render classes registered: **38**
- Render categories: **10**
- Project schema: **v3 manifest-aware**
- Roadmap status: **implemented base + expanded experimental layer set**

## Implemented milestones
1. Hidden 3D geometry controls exposed
2. Icosa geometry added
3. Render registry introduced
4. Image-driven particle layout
5. Video-driven particle layout
6. Text / glyph particle layout
7. Brush / filament connection lines
8. Membrane surface
9. Reaction diffusion surface
10. Volume fog stack
11. Convex shell surface
12. Surface patch reconstruction
13. Material style family
14. Glyph outline lines
15. Metaball styling / pulse
16. Fog material styling / anisotropy
17. Project export/import redesign
18. Schema-aware manifest
19. Fiber field
20. Growth field
21. Brush surface wash

## Immediate next targets
### A. Deposition / erosion field
Goal: create visuals that accumulate or dissolve over time rather than only move.

### B. Voxel / lattice growth
Goal: extend growth beyond strands into chunked or crystalline accretion.

### C. Brush volume
Goal: move from stacked paint planes toward true painterly volumetric strokes.

### D. Capability matrix
Goal: formalize each renderer as:
- WebGL stable
- WebGPU preferred
- export-heavy
- mobile-risky

### E. Renderer plugin contract
Goal: replace the current ad-hoc additions with a manifest-driven scene plugin structure.

## Priority order
1. deposition / erosion field
2. voxel or lattice growth
3. brush volume
4. capability matrix
5. renderer plugin contract

## Numerical progress model
### Implemented now
- experimental surface systems: 6
- strand / growth systems: 4
- media/text driven sources: 3
- special blob/volume systems: 5
- material-style aware systems: 5+

### Success criteria for next phase
- 40+ registered render classes
- 12+ milestone families
- plugin metadata added for every custom renderer
- one-click grouping for depiction families

## Notes
This roadmap is depiction-first.
The question is not whether visuals can be unified into one GPU path, but whether the system can continue to widen the class of visuals it can depict while remaining editable and serializable.

## Newly completed
- Deposition / Erosion Field: sedimentary ridge surface driven by layer motion and audio.

- Crystal aggregation was added after deposition as a dedicated instanced-solid procedural surface/structure hybrid.

- Added erosion trail network rendering for layered runoff / gully streak structures.

- Voxel / lattice aggregation

- Crystal deposition hybrid surface
