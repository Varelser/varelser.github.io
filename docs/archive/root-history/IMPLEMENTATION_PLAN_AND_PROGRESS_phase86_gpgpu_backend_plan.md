# Phase 86 — GPGPU backend planning and runtime fallback

- Added `gpgpuExecutionPreference` (`auto` / `webgl` / `webgpu`).
- Added `requestedBackend` to the GPGPU execution foundation.
- Scene GPGPU runtime now resolves backend through the shared foundation instead of reading `gpgpuWebGPUEnabled` directly.
- WebGPU request now falls back to WebGL through the same resolver when WebGPU state is unavailable.
- Diagnostics overlay now shows requested vs resolved backend for GPGPU.
