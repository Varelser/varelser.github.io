# Phase 78 — Hybrid Volumetric Foundation

## Goal
Add the first real new execution foundation after routing/foundation setup, without breaking the current procedural families.

## Why this first
Volumetric rendering is the highest-leverage next base because it expands:
- volume fog beyond slice planes
- future SDF / cavity / melt / dissolve paths
- later granular-fluid-cloud hybrids

It also fixes a runtime gap from the previous routing stage: volume-fog modes could resolve away from `webgl-procedural-surface` without a layer-local renderer to take over.

## Implemented in this phase
1. Added `VolumetricFieldSystem` as a new layer-local hybrid volumetric renderer.
2. Routed `volume-fog` family to `hybrid-runtime` when volumetric runtime is active.
3. Connected `AppScene` so hybrid volume layers render through the new system.

## Files changed
- `components/sceneVolumetricFieldSystem.tsx`
- `components/AppScene.tsx`
- `lib/executionFoundation.ts`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AND_PROGRESS_phase78_hybrid_volumetric_foundation.md`

## Validation
- `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`
- `node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build`

## Notes
This is intentionally narrow:
- not yet a full WebGPU compute foundation
- not yet a general SDF field runtime
- not yet replacing slice fog for every volume mode

It is the first real post-foundation execution path that can be selected by runtime routing.

## Next
1. Add diagnostics surfacing for hybrid volumetric path.
2. Introduce shared volumetric field uniforms / source resolver.
3. Choose the next true execution base:
   - WebGPU compute particle/grid runtime, or
   - SDF/raymarch field runtime expansion.
