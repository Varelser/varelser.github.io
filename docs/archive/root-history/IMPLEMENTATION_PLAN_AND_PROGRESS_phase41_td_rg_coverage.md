# Phase 41 — TouchDesigner / Red Giant coverage foundation

## Goal
Add a schema-aware coverage layer that treats depiction expansion as a matrix of:
- source families
- motion families
- render families
- compute backends
- post families
- GPGPU features

This phase does **not** attempt product cloning.
It adds the abstraction needed to measure and expand toward TouchDesigner-like and Red Giant-like coverage without deleting existing families.

## Implemented in this phase
1. Expanded `depictionCoverage.ts` from 4 axes to 7 axes:
   - depiction methods
   - motion families
   - compute backends
   - source families
   - render families
   - post families
   - GPGPU features

2. Expanded project manifest schema to include:
   - `coverage` arrays in export/import snapshots
   - `sourceFamilyCount`
   - `renderFamilyCount`
   - `postFamilyCount`

3. Updated Project IO panel to show:
   - counts for Sources / Renders / Post FX
   - explicit coverage rows for source families, render families, and post families

4. Added product-inspired starter packs without hard-coding vendor dependency:
   - Touch Feedback Topology
   - Touch POP Force Cloud
   - Trapcode Particular Noir
   - Trapcode Form Lattice
   - Universe Retro Feedback
   - Audio Reactive Operator Stack

## Why this order
If preset packs are added before coverage is measurable, expansion becomes opaque and harder to audit.
This phase makes future gap-filling mechanical instead of subjective.

## Remaining high-value next steps
### Phase 42
Add explicit scorecards for missing source families and render bands:
- text-glyph
- image-map
- video-map
- mesh/surface emitters
- spline/path emitters
- brush/paint emitters
- instanced object swarms
- raymarch / SDF render bands

### Phase 43
Split post stack into a more explicit reusable operator layer:
- bloom
- starglow / shine-like streaks
- RGB split / chromatic aberration
- feedback echo
- retro scanline/noise/distortion
- displacement / heat haze

### Phase 44
Move from recipe chains toward graph-like operator routing:
- emitter → sim → render → post
- branch / merge
- product-parity preset bundles built on top of graph nodes

## Validation
- TypeScript typecheck passed
- Vite build passed

## Notes
Build still reports large chunks in `three-core` and main `index`.
That is a packaging/performance task, not a correctness failure.
