# Phase 80 — Hybrid Patch Foundation

## Goal
Add a third hybrid execution foundation that is distinct from legacy procedural surface routing and can be reused by later hybrid field families.

## Implemented
- Added `lib/hybridRuntimeShared.ts` for shared source influence and audio drive utilities.
- Added `components/sceneHybridSurfacePatchSystem.tsx` as a third hybrid runtime renderer.
- Routed `surface-patch` family to `hybrid-runtime` when `hybridPatchEnabled` is on.
- Added global toggle for Hybrid Patch Surface.

## Why now
This keeps the roadmap efficient: after volumetric and SDF shell, patch is the next low-risk family for validating a reusable hybrid runtime path before moving into heavier compute foundations.
