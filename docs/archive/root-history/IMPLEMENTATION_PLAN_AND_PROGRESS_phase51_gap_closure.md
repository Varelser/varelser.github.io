# Phase 51 — motion / render / source / post gap closure

## What was implemented
- Added three gap-closure product packs to cover the remaining motion/render/source/post targets.
- Corrected coverage mapping so GPGPU shell emitters count toward `shell-volume` and GPGPU instancing counts toward `instanced-geometry`.
- Verified typecheck and production build after changes.

## New packs
1. Niagara Chaos Magnetic Tubes
   - covers chaos / swarm / magnetic / elastic motion
   - covers gpu-tubes and random-scatter / aux / sdf-assisted render paths
2. Houdini Shell Metaball Volume
   - covers shell-volume source
   - covers gpu-metaballs / gpu-volumetric and vignette-darken paths
3. Hybrid Contact SDF Scatter
   - covers random-scatter source
   - covers contact-fx / sdf-shading / vignette / instanced-geometry / aux-particles

## Coverage result
Measured against the current internal target set:
- total targets: 92
- covered: 92
- overall coverage: 100%
- product packs: 25
- families: 8

Axis coverage:
- source: 14 / 14
- render: 24 / 24
- post: 20 / 20
- compute: 7 / 7
- motion: 17 / 17
- solver: 10 / 10

## Notes
- This is 100% against the project's current measured target registry, not a claim that every conceivable generation method in existence is exhausted.
- The next meaningful phase is no longer simple gap filling. It should shift to either:
  - deeper sub-axes inside each family, or
  - quality / performance / chunk-splitting / UI reachability improvements.
