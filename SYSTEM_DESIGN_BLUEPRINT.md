# Kalokagathia Particle Generator — System Design Blueprint

## 1. Purpose
This project is no longer treated as a single particle renderer.
It is a layered visual system for combining:
- source layouts
- motion/simulation
- render classes
- material styles
- post processing
- project state

The main design goal is breadth of depiction rather than forcing every visual through one GPU pathway.

## 2. Core architectural idea
Each visible result is the combination of five axes.

1. Source
   - sphere, ring, grid, plane, image, video, text
2. Motion / simulation
   - flow, curl, orbit, sheet, reaction diffusion, volume fog, fiber, growth, etc.
3. Render class
   - particles, lines, ribbons, solids, surfaces, volumetrics, metaballs
4. Material style
   - classic, glass, hologram, chrome, halftone
5. Post FX
   - bloom, chromatic aberration, DOF, overlays

## 3. Runtime composition
- `App.tsx` owns workspace state, presets, sequence state, and project import/export.
- `components/AppScene.tsx` routes each layer to the correct renderer.
- `lib/renderModeRegistry.ts` tracks active render classes, support level, and progress metrics.
- `lib/projectState.ts` builds exportable project manifests and summary counts.

## 4. Layer model
### Layer 1
Primary particle field / legacy core layer.

### Layer 2 and Layer 3
Experimental expansion layers. These can switch among:
- particle rendering
- membrane/surface rendering
- reconstructed shells/patches
- fog volumes
- fiber and growth structures
- text/image/video driven layouts

### GPGPU layer
Separate high-density pathway for metaballs, smooth tubes, and dense GPU-oriented visuals.

## 5. Current render-class map
### Particles
- layer points/sprites
- image-driven layout
- video-driven layout
- text/glyph layout

### Lines / strands
- classic connections
- brush connection strips
- filament connection strips
- glyph outline lines
- fiber field strands
- growth branch structures

### Surfaces
- membrane surface
- reaction diffusion surface
- convex shell surface
- reconstructed surface patch
- brush surface wash

### Volumetric
- fog stack
- fog material styling
- fog glow / anisotropy

### Solids / blobs
- instanced solids
- metaballs
- metaball material styling
- metaball pulse modulation

## 6. Data and persistence
Project persistence now uses versioned project JSON with:
- full config
- presets
- sequence state
- UI state
- schema-aware manifest
- per-layer summary
- statistical counts

This keeps exports migration-friendly even when the config object grows.

## 7. Extension rule
New depiction modes should be added by following this sequence:
1. define layer type / settings
2. add scene system component
3. route through `AppScene.tsx`
4. register class in `renderModeRegistry.ts`
5. expose controls in layer panel
6. reflect in project manifest features
7. document in roadmap

## 8. Current bottlenecks
- Large control panel files for Layer 2 and Layer 3
- Some render systems still duplicate material-style logic
- Render registry is summary-driven rather than full plugin metadata
- Capability routing is still heuristic, not formalized per system

## 9. Recommended next architecture step
Move from ad-hoc scene systems toward a clearer plugin contract:
- id
- label
- category
- support level
- settings schema
- scene component
- manifest features
- performance classification

That would make future additions such as deposition, erosion, voxel growth, or brush volumes much easier to add.

## Additional surface family
- Deposition / Erosion Field: a stratified terrain-like surface class for sediment, cuts, and weathered accumulation.

- Crystal aggregation extends the specialized render-class family by sampling particle motion into clustered solid formations.

- Added erosion trail network rendering for layered runoff / gully streak structures.

- Voxel / lattice aggregation as a snapped instanced-solid field

- Hybrid strata-crystal rendering combines sediment surfaces with instanced crystalline growth.
